# flask-donations-webapp
A donations (not including monetary donations) web application using flask, MySQL for backend and tailwindcss for styling with a very user friendly interface.
It has two user roles: donor and an organization. Donors after signing up can search for organizations based on the location they provide and easily schedule a donation package pickup request from any organization. Donor can also view sent and previous requests and cancel request at any time and view posts uploaded by the organizations. Organization on the other hand just need to signup and post their details for donors to see. They can also frequently add posts announcing about recent drives or anything. All received requests are visible to individual organizations. They can change request status or even cancel request if not able to fulfil it on time. Both users can update their details at any time as well. In-short, this project is an efficient solution for accepting and managing donations, making donating process effortless and quick for donors and a powerful tool for organizations seeking to grow their supporters and get insights on their donor base and better serve their mission.
